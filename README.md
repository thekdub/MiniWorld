# MiniWorld

MiniWorld is a Minecraft (Spigot) utility plugin for easily creating temporary instances of Minecraft worlds!
The intended use case for MiniWorld is for instanced dungeons, or other applications where a small temporary world is ideal.

## Supported Versions:
- Spigot 1.16.4

MiniWorld may function with additional versions of Minecraft, however this is untested and not guaranteed.
Support for pre-1.16 is not likely.

See https://github.com/NotThatRqd/MiniWorld2 for later Minecraft version support.

## MiniWorld Commands:

Command | Arguments | Description
------- | --------- | -----------
/mw | None | Provides information about MiniWorld and command usage
/mw list | None | Lists all worlds currently loaded into the server
